Automatic music generation model using LSTM networks, trained on Schubert piano tones to predict future notes based on a 32-note seed input. Explored a Wavenet-inspired 1D convolutional model, incorporating skip and
residual connections, but selected the LSTM model for its efficiency and accuracy in generating piano music
